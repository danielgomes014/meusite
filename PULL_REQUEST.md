# Fix JSX syntax error in About.jsx

## 🐛 Problem
The build was failing due to a JSX parsing error in `src/pages/About.jsx` at line 150:

```jsx
<div className="text-2xl font-bold text-green-600">< 30s</div>
```

The `< 30s` text was being interpreted by the JSX parser as an opening tag instead of literal text content, causing the error:
```
Parsing error: Identifier directly after number
```

## 🔧 Solution
Escaped the less-than symbol by wrapping the text in a JavaScript string literal:

```jsx
- <div className="text-2xl font-bold text-green-600">< 30s</div>
+ <div className="text-2xl font-bold text-green-600">{'< 30s'}</div>
```

## ✅ Verification
1. **Code Scan**: Searched entire codebase for similar issues using `grep -R "< " src --include="*.jsx"` - no other occurrences found
2. **Linting**: Ran `npm run lint` - all checks pass ✅
3. **Build**: Ran `npm run build` - successful compilation ✅
4. **Functionality**: Verified text renders correctly as "< 30s" in the UI ✅

## 📋 Files Changed
- `src/pages/About.jsx` - Fixed JSX syntax error
- `CHANGELOG.md` - Added entry documenting the fix

## 🎯 Impact
- ✅ Build process now completes successfully
- ✅ No breaking changes to UI or functionality
- ✅ Text displays exactly as intended: "< 30s"
- ✅ No other JSX parsing errors in codebase

## 🔍 Root Cause Analysis
JSX requires special handling of certain characters like `<`, `>`, and `&` when used as text content. The parser was trying to interpret `< 30s` as the beginning of a JSX element rather than literal text.

## 💡 Prevention
Added this to our development checklist:
- Always escape special characters in JSX text content
- Use `{'< text'}`, `&lt;`, or similar escaping for `<` symbols
- Run linter before committing to catch parsing errors early
