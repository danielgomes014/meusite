# Changelog

## [1.0.1] - 2024-01-XX

### Fixed
- **JSX Syntax Error**: Fixed parsing error in `About.jsx` where `< 30s` was being interpreted as a JSX tag instead of text
  - Changed `< 30s` to `{'< 30s'}` to properly escape the less-than symbol in JSX
  - Scanned entire codebase for similar issues - no other occurrences found
  - Verified with linter and build process - all tests passing

### Technical Details
- **File affected**: `src/pages/About.jsx` (line 150)
- **Root cause**: Raw `<` symbol in JSX content without proper escaping
- **Solution**: Used JavaScript string literal with curly braces for proper JSX rendering
- **Verification**: Ran `npm run lint` and `npm run build` successfully

### Development Notes
- Added automated check for similar issues using: `grep -R "< " src --include="*.jsx"`
- No additional JSX parsing errors found in the codebase
- Build process now completes without errors
- ESLint validation passes all checks
